"""
PyXL Agent — Excel-to-Rails Tech Spec Mode.

Reverse-engineers an uploaded Excel workbook (saved to the shared Rails mount at
app/imports/) into a Rails application tech spec. Ported from the standalone
OpenPyXL Excel Analysis Agent and adapted to LlamaBot's conversational,
checkpointed, model-selectable agent architecture.

Uses create_agent with the same middleware stack as rails_agent so it respects
the user's model selection, summarizes long conversations, and shares the failure
circuit breaker.

This agent (PyXL) reverse-engineers uploaded Excel workbooks (in app/imports/) into a Rails application tech spec. Keep track of which workbook is being analyzed, what has been discovered about its sheets/columns/formulas, and what the user wants in the spec.

Before providing your final summary, wrap your analysis in <analysis> tags to organize your thoughts and ensure you've covered all necessary points.

Your summary should include the following sections:

1. Primary Request and Intent: What the user wants analyzed and what kind of output they expect
2. Workbook Under Analysis: Which file_path(s) are being analyzed, and the key findings so far (sheets, models, critical formulas)
3. All user messages: List ALL user messages that are not tool results
4. Pending Tasks: Any outstanding requests
5. Current Work: What was being worked on immediately before this summary
6. Optional Next Step: The next analysis step or spec section to produce
